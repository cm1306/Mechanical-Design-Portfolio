## 🚀 Featured Project: 4 Bar Linkage Robotic Arm
**Materials:** Aluminium, PLA, acrylic  
**Tools:** SolidWorks, Bambu Studio (3D Printing), LightBurn (Laser Cutting)

### 🎯 Overview
Designed and fabricated a custom robotic arm for the Robocon 2026 competition. The arm was engineered to pick and place objects with a mass of ≈500 grams while minimising total weight.

### ⚙️ Technical Highlights
* **Weight Optimization:** Utilized topology optimization in SolidWorks to reduce linkage weight by 15% without compromising structural rigidity.
* **Transmission:** Designed a custom timing belt reduction system to increase torque for the base joint.
* **Fabrication:** Hybrid construction using **3D Printed (PLA+)** end-effectors for complex geometry and **Laser-Cut Acrylic** for structural links.
